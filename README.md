Changelog
---------

### 0.3.2

* Add additional functions to allow Ruban's support in
  [deck2pdf](https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf) which can convert HTML5
  presentations to PDF (thanks @jnizet).

### 0.3.1

* Add `first()` and `last()` functions to go to the first and last slide.
* Bind the `home` and `end` keys to these new functions.

  presentation in the footer.

### 0.3.0

* Do not reset the steps when coming from the following slide but allow passing
  them in the backward direction.
* Do not entirely strip HTML tags in the generated table of contents. It allows
  to have Font-Awesome icons in the TOC.
* Do not display the pagination when printing because it is dynamically updated
  with JavaScript and thus static and wrong in the print. You can use the
  pagination capabilities of the printer's driver to get pagination in a print.

  Disabled by default because it prevents text selection and the display of the
  context menu.
